As per the Facts are concern in this assignment:

Assignment Analysis:

When I see this assignment pdf file I found that this  some thing intersting assignment for me. 
and its chance to polish my java skills again especially java.io package.

Topic Understandability:

When I reasearch on this topic I found the files which has to be downloaded and saved into your local machine.
Afterwards make one file which contain comma seprated values(.csv) of that data in a given format.
 
Development Strategy:

While Seeing this question I make a algorithm to complete this assignment.
I get few hurdels in case of data consistency because sometimes url change occurs and sometimes data downloaded in files is not consistent.
rather than this i didnt think so that i get any problem to code.
